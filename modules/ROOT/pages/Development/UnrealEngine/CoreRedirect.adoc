= Core Redirect

A Core Redirect is an Unreal Engine system that allows you to tell the game and editor to expect to find an asset path in a different location than usual.

You can learn more about them
https://www.unrealdirective.com/articles/core-redirectors-what-you-need-to-know[here]
or
https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/core-redirects-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.3[on the Unreal docs].
Note that the Unreal docs are partly incorrect
and claim that the OldName of PackageRedirects will work without the slashes present.
You should follow the example here or on the UnrealDirective docs page instead.

== Setting up a Core Redirect

Because we're creating Unreal Plugins and not a full game, modders have to go through a few extra steps to set these up.

=== Write the Redirect

First identify the package, or assets, that needs to be moved via the redirect.

You will need to create a new file, `YourModReference/Config/Engine.ini`, to hold the core redirects.

The process for creating this file can be found
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/Adding_Ingame_Mod_Icon.adoc#_modify_packaging_settings[here].

==== Example: Changed Mod Reference

An example use case for core redirects is if a mod has changed mod reference,
but you want users' buildings or other content from the past mod reference to persist.

This was used to seamlessly port old all buildings in the
https://ficsit.app/mod/BuildableResourceNodesRedux[Buildable Resource Nodes Redux] mod.

This core redirect will redirect every asset stored in player's save files
from the old `BuildableResourceNodes` plugin to the new `BuildableResourceNodesRedux` plugin.
In this specific example, this means that all of the FGBuildables from the old mod
will not vanish when players update to the one with the new mod reference.

==== Example: Ensure Buildings and Unlocks Remain when their Assets are Moved

This was used in the
https://ficsit.app/mod/AB_FluidExtras[Fluid Extras] mod
to ensure that a specific type of buildable (90 degree Pipe Bends) already present in users' save files
would persist after the developer moved the building's assets from one location to another.

It relocates 3 different assets for this purpose:

- The Buildable, which is actually stored in the save file
- The Recipe, which is stored in a list of unlocked recipes, and could be referenced by another mod
- The Descriptor, which could be referenced by another mod
- (Redirecting the Schematic was not necessary because it was not moved in this specific case)

=== Modify Packaging Settings

In order to tell Unreal to package your core redirect with your plugin,
you will need to add a line to your plugin's `YourModReference/Config/PluginSettings.ini`
to tell it to include your `Engine.ini` with the mod's files.

The process for creating this file can be found
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/Adding_Ingame_Mod_Icon.adoc#_modify_packaging_settings[here].

The attribute "+AdditionalNonUSFDirectories" tells Alpakit that we wish to include a directory during the packaging of our mod.

=== Package Your Mod and Test

It's very easy to mess up the syntax on core redirects,
so you should be sure to launch the game and test to make sure it actually worked.

If you're testing out core redirects, you don't need to repackage the mod every time.
You can simply edit the `Engine.ini` in the plugin folder for the mod in the game install directory and relaunch the game.
Remember that packaging the mod again will overwrite any changes you made to this file!

If it doesn't seem to be working, make sure your syntax is correct.
For example, Class Redirects usually have a `_C` suffix in the OldName and newName fields.

You may find the `-DebugCoreRedirects` launch argument useful in your testing.
It adds additional information to UE logs to help identify core redirect issues, including typos.
Learn how to launch your game with launch arguments on the xref:faq.adoc#_게임을_시작할_때_실행_인수를_어떻게_설정합니까[FAQ page].

== Using Core Redirects in the Editor

It's possible that, after an update, the parent class of one of your assets has changed due to Coffee Stain or another mod developer moving the location of the class on their end.

You can set up a Core Redirect in order to tell Unreal about the location of the new parent class,
which may make make it possible to open the asset in the editor again.

In this case, you probably want to use a Class Redirect instead.
See the docs page linked link:#_core_redirect[above] for more info.

Since this time the redirect does not need to be present for end users,
you need to add the redirect in the `ProjectFolder/Config/DefaultEngine.ini` file instead.
Outside of this, the syntax for the actual redirect is the same as if it was in the plugin `Engine.ini` file.
