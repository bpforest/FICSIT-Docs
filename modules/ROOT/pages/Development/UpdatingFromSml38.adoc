= Upgrading from SML 3.8.0 to 3.9.x

SML3.9 fixes some bugs, adds developer utilities,
and helps end users avoid installing mods improperly in multiplayer.
Mods compiled for SML3.8 should work with SML3.9,
but any mods using Blueprint Hook Helper may need to update their code.
Even the mods that need to update their code shouldâ„¢ work because the old functions are inline or template.

Please _read this entire page before you begin updating your mod_.
It will save you time later to have an idea going in of what to expect while updating.
After you have finished reading this page,
follow the directions on the
xref:Development/UpdatingToNewVersions.adoc[Updating your Mod]
guide to install the updated engine, starter project, and update your mod.

== New Features

This section talks about the new features that SML 3.9 brings to the table.

=== Clients Check Server Mods when Joining

In previous SML versions, servers were able to reject client connections if the client was missing required mods installed on the server.
SML 3.9 now implements this check for clients.
Clients will refuse to join servers that are missing mods present on the client side.
The existing `RequiredOnRemote` and `RemoteVersionRange` uplugin fields control this behavior.
Read more about them in the xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/ReleaseMod.adoc#_special_fields[uplugin Special Fields section].

=== Wwise Support 

SML 3.9.1 enables mods to make use of some of the game's Wwise sound system.
See the xref:Development/Satisfactory/Audio.adoc[Audio] page for more information.

=== Quick Launch Script Supports Multiplayer

The xref:Development/TestingResources.adoc#LaunchScript[Quick Launch Script]
is once again capable of launching local multiplayer games to test with.
Additionally, the `-loadLatestSave` and `-multiplayer` options are now compatible,
and the `-clientAutoJoin` option has been added to make the client automatically connect to the host.

[id="NewFeatures_BPHookHelper"]
=== Blueprint Hook Helper

The Blueprint Hook Helper has been extended to enable easier access to FProperties,
FMapProperties, and FStructProperties.
See `BlueprintHookHelper.h` for more details.

=== Example Mod Improvements

ExampleMod has been enhanced with additional examples:

- https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader/pull/311[Significant enhancements]
  to Example Level and the tools for creating custom levels
- Schematic CDO edit example
- ExampleItem now has a custom inventory description widget

=== Mass Asset Reparenter

This editor utility allows you to easily change the parent class of multiple assets at once.

Read more on the xref:Development/EditorTools/SMLEditor/SMLEditor.adoc[SML Editor Utilities] page.

=== ADA Message Extractor

This utility loads all FGMessage assets in the project and compiles data about them into one string.
It can be useful for viewing what speaking patterns ADA and the Aliens use when speaking
without having to hunt through lots of separate message assets.

Read more on the xref:Development/EditorTools/SMLEditor/SMLEditor.adoc[SML Editor Utilities] page.

=== Alpakit Release: Open Folder

The Alpakit Release window now has a button to open the output directory that contains packaged mod files for upload.

=== Launch Argument: ExecCmds

SML now reimplements the Unreal Engine `ExecCmds` launch argument (normally excluded from shipping builds).
It enables automatically executing xref:SMLChatCommands.adoc#ConsoleCommands[Unreal Console Commands]
after the game loads.

You can read more about it in the 
https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-command-line-arguments-reference[Unreal documentation]

The xref:Development/TestingResources.adoc#LaunchScript[Quick Launch Script]
uses this argument to implement the `-clientAutoJoin` flag.

== Relevant Base Game Changes for Modding

This section highlights some changes Coffee Stain has made to the base-game specifically for modders to utilize.

- Fixed FFGDynamicStruct missing a NetSerializer
- Added API for working with the new Lightweight Buildable Subsystem for modders
- New launch arguments (covered in more detail below)

=== Launch Argument: CustomConfig

Added in CL382498, the `-CustomConfig=` allows you to override an additional layer of configs compiled into the game.
Using exactly `-CustomConfig=` (specifying an empty string as the value)
enables xref:Development/TestingResources.adoc[local multiplayer testing] by giving the host a consistent GUID/playername
and clients random GUIDs that persist as long as their game client stays open (game instance).

=== Launch Argument: ini Overrides

Added in CL382498, the `-ini:Config:[Section]:Value=` argument allows overriding ini config values via launch arguments.

This behavior was previously possible using the `-EngineINI=` argument,
but that approach requires creating an ini file to pass in
and the engine would fill it with unrelated values on launch.

For example, the xref:Development/TestingResources.adoc#LaunchScript[Quick Launch Script]
now uses this instead of the `EngineINI` argument:

`-ini:Engine:[/Script/EngineSettings.GameMapsSettings]:GameDefaultMap=/Game/FactoryGame/Map/GameLevel01/Persistent_Level.Persistent_Level,[/Script/EngineSettings.GameMapsSettings]:LocalMapOptions=?skipOnboarding?loadgame=saveGameFilename`

Another example - this argument can be used to raise the multiplayer max player count:

`-ini:Engine:[SystemSettings]:net.MaxPlayersOverride=10`

== Notable Fixes

=== Reliable Buffer Overflow

Mircea has created a standalone mod to address one of the causes of the Reliable Buffer Overflow issue.
See https://ficsit.app/mod/FixReliableBufferOverflow[its mod page] for more information.

=== Content Registry Issue with Mod Schematics Depending on Vanilla Schematics

Mods can now alter vanilla content to unlock-depend on modded content without breaking its registration.
See https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader/issues/248[this github issue for more info].

=== Buildables with Empty Cost Now Finish their Build Animation

This base-game bug has been fixed.
https://www.answeroverflow.com/m/1290190197501460521[Source].

== Not Done Yet

The following features are not quite ready to use yet.

=== Advanced Game Settings values not saved

The xref:Development/ModLoader/SessionSettings.adoc[Session Settings] page
explains how you can create your own Advanced Game Settings.
However, their values are not currently saved with the save file.
Session Settings still function correctly - their values are saved.

=== Content Bundle Cooking

The optimal way to add modded content to the game world (like ore nodes, deposits, etc.)
is to use the Content Bundle system,
but Unreal currently refuses to cook content bundles unless the world is also cooked.
This is a https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader/issues/155[known bug]
and will be fixed in a future SML release.

The next best way is to use sublevel spawning. Here is an example from Kyrium of how to do that:

* https://github.com/Satisfactory-KMods/KBFL/blob/d21381de3621d25f063ecfbf24b5d35533da4357/Source/KBFL/Private/Subsystems/ResourceNodes/KBFLSubLevelSpawning.cpp#L41[KBFLSubLevelSpawning]
* https://github.com/Satisfactory-KMods/KBFL/blob/d21381de3621d25f063ecfbf24b5d35533da4357/Source/KBFL/Private/Subsystems/KBFLResourceNodeSubsystem.cpp#L67[KBFLResourceNodeSubsystem]

== Required Changes

In addition to any specific-to-your-mod issues you may encounter,
the changes described below _must_ be made in order for your mod to be updated.

- There are no required changes for this SML update!

== Additional Changes

You might not be affected by these changes,
but we'd like to draw extra attention to them.

[id="Changes_BPHookHelper"]
=== Blueprint Hook Helper

In addition to the link:#NewFeatures_BPHookHelper[new blueprint hooking features],
the handling of blueprint hook properties has been unified,
resulting in some old methods being changed.

Consider this example from the Faster Manual Crafting Redux mod:

SML 3.8 version:

```cpp
int32* numSparksToAdd = helper.GetLocalVarPtr<FIntProperty>(TEXT("NumberOfSparks"));
```

SML 3.9 version:

```cpp
int32* numSparksToAdd = helper.GetLocalVariableHelper()->GetVariablePtr<FIntProperty>(TEXT("NumberOfSparks"));
```

Consider this example from SML's item description widget hook:

SML 3.8 version:

```cpp
UUserWidget* TooltipWidget = Cast<UUserWidget>(*HookHelper.GetOutVariablePtr<FObjectProperty>());
```

SML 3.9 version:

```cpp
UUserWidget* TooltipWidget = Cast<UUserWidget>(*HookHelper.GetOutVariableHelper()->GetVariablePtr<FObjectProperty>(TEXT("ReturnValue")));
```
