Introduced in SML3.8, the Content Tag Registry is an
xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc#_게임_인스턴스_할당_모듈ugameinstancemodule[Game Instance]
xref:Development/ModLoader/Subsystems.adoc[Subsystem]
that manages
https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-gameplay-tags-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.3[Gameplay Tag Containers]
at a per-class level to be utilized by mod systems.

Gameplay Tags are essentially a structured hierarchical system of FName tags that Unreal has built further libraries and optimizations around.
Since the tags are text-based, using this system makes implementing cross-mod interactions with no hard dependencies easier.

Tags do not inherently do anything by themselves, but other systems can use them to control behavior.

== Tag Usage Examples

Learn more about practical use cases for Gameplay Tags in 
https://www.tomlooman.com/unreal-engine-gameplaytags-data-driven-design/[this blog post].

=== SML Special Item Descriptor Tag

By adding the `SML.Registry.Item.SpecialItemDescriptor` tag to an item descriptor, the 
`GetObtainableItemDescriptors` and `IsDescriptorFilteredOut` utilities in `UModContentRegistry` will consider it a Special item descriptor,
meaning it will be filtered according to usage of the `EGetObtainableItemDescriptorsFlags::IncludeSpecial` flag.

== Limitations

=== Registry Freeze

The tag registry is frozen at the same time as the Content Registry.
It's not possible to add more tags to a class after the registry is frozen.

=== Lookup

Unlike other tags systems you may be familiar with, neither Unreal nor SML provide a system for looking up what content has a specific tag.
For example, you can't ask the system to give you a list of every FGItemDescriptor class with the "ReallyCool" tag.

If this behavior is desired it must be implemented separately.
An example implementation could build these records by iterating over all registered item descriptor classes and checking them for the "ReallyCool" tag.
Caching the results is highly recommended because they should never change after the registry is frozen.

=== Not Replicated

Since the Content Registry state is not replicated, neither is the Content Tag Registry.
Tags must be set up on both server and client for the data to be consistent.

=== Class-level Tagging

Unreal Engine makes few assumptions about how Content Tags are used to allow for implementation flexibility.
Tag containers are structs that can be returned by anything or used by anything.

SML's Content Tag Registry implementation only assists with managing tags at the UClass level.
Tagging arbitrary UObjects, for example, must be implemented separately.

== Defining Tags

Satisfactory Mod Loader adds mod config folders to Unreal Engine's search path as a gameplay tag source,
allowing each mod to define Gameplay Tags via config files even though they are typically a project-level setting.

Use the in-editor gameplay tag editor to define new tags and tag sources.
You can find this manager in any editor field that uses gameplay tags, or by going to
`Edit` > `Project Settings...` > (Project heading) `GameplayTags` > `Gameplay Tag List`.

To define new tags, you must first create a tag source for your mod.
To do this, open the "Add New Tag Source" section of the manager.
Make sure your mod reference is included in the "Name" so it can be distinguished later.
For example, `YourModReferenceGameplayTags.ini`.
Select your mod in the "Config Path" dropdown, then press `Add New Source`.

Once you have a tag source, open the "Add New Gameplay Tag" section to define new tags.
Make sure to follow the link:#TagNameConventions[Tag Naming Conventions] when defining new tags.
Leave a comment explaining the purpose of the tag, which will appear in editor hover tooltips.
Finally, pick your mod's ini as the Source and press `Add New Tag`.

Tag comments can be edited later in the tag source ini file.

[id="TagNameConventions"]
=== Tag Naming Conventions

UE Tags are hierarchical with each "level" separated by periods.
For an example, see https://www.tomlooman.com/unreal-engine-gameplaytags-data-driven-design/[this blog post]
and https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-gameplay-tags-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.3[the UE documentation].

Tag names should be written with this behavior in mind.

If your tag is intended to apply to a specific asset type, consider using that as a prefix.

If your tag pertains to something specific to your mod, consider prefixing the tag with your mod reference.

Example general tag names:

* ✔️ `Item.Organic`
    ** Organic, compostable material
    ** SML defines this tag and has already applied it to multiple vanilla items
* ✔️ `Recipe.Package`
    ** Combines resources and packages into a Packaged item
    ** SML defines this tag and has already applied it to multiple vanilla recipes

Example mod-specific tag names

* ✔️ `MyCoolMod.Item.SpecialGeneratorFuel`
    ** This tag could be used to allow other mods to enable their fuels to be burned in your mod's custom generator building.

Poor tag names:

* ❌ `Item.Radioactive`
    ** Items already have the `mRadioactiveDecay` field to indicate radioactivity.
* ❌ `Item.Liquid` / `Item.Gas` / `Item.Solid`
    ** Items already have the `mForm` field to indicate resource state.
* ❌ `Item.RawResource` / `Item.Biomass` / `Item.NuclearFuel`
    ** The base game already uses specific classes to differentiate these. Consider using those instead.
* ❌ `Thing`
    ** Not specific enough to be useful.

== Applying Tags to Assets

SML provides multiple approaches for applying tags in the registry.

=== Extended Attribute Provider Interface

If your mod owns the asset you wish to tag, you can implement the `ISMLExtendedAttributeProvider` interface on it to offer tags.
It's convenient for defining an item's tags on the item itself, keeping all the details in one place.

Epic's existing `IGameplayTagAssetInterface` is not useful for modding purposes because it must be implemented in {cpp}
and we often want to apply tags to assets we don't have control over the parent class structure of, like FGItemDescriptors.

=== Tag Table

The Tag Table approach is ideal when the content you wish to tag is accessible in the editor, but not necessarily owned by your mod.
For example, applying tags to vanilla assets or assets from other mods.
It's also useful for bringing in tag data from an external source like a spreadsheet.

To get started, go to a Content Browser window in the editor and create a new Data Table asset (it's an Advanced Asset in the Miscellaneous category).
You'll be prompted to select a Row Structure, pick `ContentTagRegistryAddition` from the dropdown.

- Row names must be unique but are ignored by code.
- Use the `Class` column to specify the asset you want to tag.
- Use the `Tag Container` column to supply the tags to apply to the asset.

Register the data table by adding it 

=== Script Calls

If you need to apply tags based programatically based on some kind of condition,
or need want to tag assets that might not exist at editor time,
use the methods offered by the Content Tag Registry.

Use `UContentTagRegistry:AddGameplayTagsTo` to register tags directly or `UContentTagRegistry:RegisterTagAdditionTable` to register a Data Table.

== Removing Tags from Assets

=== Script Calls

Use `UContentTagRegistry:RemoveGameplayTagsFrom` to remove a tag.
This will only work before the registry is frozen.

There is no "removal record" left behind, so something else could theoretically add the tag back later.
You probably want to call this late in the loading process to avoid that.

== Checking Assets for Tags

You can query the Content Tag Registry to get the "final" tag container for a class,
which is an unmodifiable copy of the aggregated tags the class has from all sources.

From there, standard UE methods can be used to operate on the tag container.

[id="CheckTags_Blueprint"]
=== In Blueprint

Use either available "GetContentTagRegistry" node to get a reference to the registry,
then use `Get Gameplay Tag Container For` to get the tag container for a class.

From there, use tag container methods like "Has Tag" and "Has All" to make decisions based on what tags are present.

"GetDebugStringFromGameplayTagContainer" can be useful for debugging.

[id="CheckTags_Cpp"]
=== In C++

Use `UContentTagRegistry:GetGameplayTagContainerFor` to get the tag container for a class.

From there, use
https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/GameplayTags/FGameplayTagContainer?application_version=5.3[tag container methods].

== Using Tags from Other Mods

Since tags are defined by string names,
if you want to use a tag name from another mod without that mod's source in your editor,
simply create a new tag source in your own mod for the other source with the exact same hierarchical tag name.
